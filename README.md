## Hi, I'm Olga 👋 

**Software Developer · Engineering Lead · LLM Agent Systems Engineer**

I am a software developer with more than a decade of professional experience in backend engineering, system architecture, and technical leadership.  
My current focus is the design, orchestration, and practical application of **LLM-driven agent systems** for real-world engineering tasks.

I work at the intersection of:
- classical software engineering,
- distributed systems,
- automation and orchestration,
- applied AI (LLMs as infrastructure, not demos).

---

## What I do

- Design and build **production-grade backend systems**
- Architect **APIs, data models, and integrations** under real constraints
- Lead engineering teams and technical decision-making
- Build and operate **LLM agent systems** (task decomposition, tool use, coordination, evaluation)
- Turn ambiguous product ideas into working, maintainable systems

I strongly prefer **explicit architecture**, **observable systems**, and **boring, reliable solutions** over clever abstractions.

## Core Expertise

### Software Engineering
- Backend architecture and system design
- API development (REST, GraphQL, integrations)
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, ElasticSearch
- Performance optimization and refactoring
- Security-driven development (PCI, risk assessment)

### Languages & Platforms
- Ruby / Ruby on Rails (deep production experience)
- Go, Python (infrastructure, tooling, agents)
- SQL (design, optimization, show me the query plan)
- Docker, AWS, Heroku
- Distributed systems in practice, not theory

### LLM & Agent Systems
- Multi-agent architectures
- Tool-augmented agents
- Agent orchestration and coordination
- Prompt engineering as system design
- Evaluation, failure modes, and control surfaces
- Using LLMs as *workers*, not *oracles*

---

## Principles I Work By

- Simplicity beats cleverness
- Most problems are solved by **clear data flow**
- 90% of tasks should be solved with boring code  
  The remaining 10% are why experience matters
- LLMs amplify engineers; they don’t replace thinking
- Architecture is a responsibility, not a diagram

## Currently Interested In

- Agentic software development
