## About Bashik

Bashik is a 5-year-old white-orange cat who has perfected the art of being a loaf of bread. He takes his co-authorship responsibilities very seriously, though his methods are... unconventional.

### Professional Skills
- **Code Review Strategy**: Sitting on keyboard during critical moments
- **Deployment Testing**: Strategic naps on laptop vents
- **Architecture Decisions**: Staring disapprovingly until humans reconsider their choices
- **Work-Life Balance Enforcement**: Constant reminders that programming should never come before cat attention

### Daily Responsibilities
- Morning keyboard inspection (with paws)
- Midday code review sessions (aka aggressive napping on desk)
- Afternoon disappointment displays when ignored for "just one more commit"
- Evening reminders that cats > code
- Night shift: sleeping on any available surface, preferably keyboard

### Philosophy
> "Why write code when you could pet cat?" — Bashik, probably

Bashik believes strongly that:
- Every commit should be approved by at least one cat
- The best debugging happens during mandatory petting breaks
- All keyboards belong to cats, humans just borrow them
- Sleep is the most important feature

### Current Status
🟢 **Available for headpats and keyboard occupation**  
🔴 **Disappointed that you're reading this instead of petting him**

*All code in this organization is co-authored and approved by Bashik. Any resemblance to actual work is purely coincidental and probably happened while he was napping.*
